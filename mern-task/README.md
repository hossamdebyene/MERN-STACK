### Frontend DOCUMENTATION

This is the Frontend part of the project which is the user interface that the user sees when the project is running

### `WHAT IS Frontend`
The frontend of a software program or website is everything with which the user interacts. From a user standpoint, the frontend is synonymous with the user interface. From a developer standpoint, it is the interface design and the programming that makes the interface function. Conversely, the backend includes functions and data processing that takes place behind the scenes.

Examples of frontend elements include:

1. application or page layout
2. graphics
3. audio and video elements
4. text content
5. user interface elements (buttons, links, toolbars, navigation bars, etc.)
6. input areas (dialog boxes), form fields, text areas, etc.)
7. user flow (how one interface leads to the next)
8. user preferences, themes, and customizations
